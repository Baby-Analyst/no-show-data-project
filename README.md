 ### Question(s) for Analysis
> Eventually, we need to answer the following question from the analysis of the dataset:
*  Are reminders helpful?
*  What percentage of people show up for appointments?
*  Do scholarships encourage people more?
*  Is there any correlation between age/gender and showing up for appointments?
*  What other factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?



This analysis involved data wrangling, exploratory analysis, vizualisation and drawing conclusions.
